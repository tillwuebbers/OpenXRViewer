# OpenXRViewer

A 360Â° photo viewer for my master's thesis 'Enhancing Stereoscopic Image Quality in Virtual Reality by Means of High-Fidelity Texture Filtering'. It implements different texture sampling methods to compare the effects of sampling equirectangular textures in regards to aliasing effects.

The code is based on the OpenXR SDK demo (https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenXR-SDK-Source/tree/main/src/tests/hello_xr).
